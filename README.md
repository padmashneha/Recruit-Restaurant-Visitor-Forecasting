# Recruit Restaurant Visitor Forecasting


Running a successful restaurant involves more than just creating delicious dishes and providing excellent service. One of the challenges that restaurants face is predicting the number of customers they can expect on any given day. This prediction is crucial for efficient ingredient procurement, staff scheduling, and overall business planning. The Restaurant Visitor Forecasting project aims to address this challenge by leveraging key datasets provided by Recruit Holdings.

## Problem Statement

The primary objective of this project is to use reservation and visitation data to predict the total number of visitors a restaurant can expect for future dates. This predictive model will be a valuable tool for restaurant owners and managers, enabling them to plan and allocate resources effectively. The dataset provided includes information from various Recruit Holdings services, including Hot Pepper Gourmet (a restaurant review service), AirREGI (a restaurant point of sales service), and Restaurant Board (reservation log management software).

## Data Overview

The dataset comprises a combination of reservation and visitation data, offering a comprehensive view of customer behavior. Understanding and analyzing this data is essential for building an accurate forecasting model. The features include information about reservations, time of day, dates, and potentially other relevant factors that influence restaurant attendance.

## Dataset Components

**Hot Pepper Gourmet Data:**
Provides insights from a restaurant review service, giving information about customer preferences and ratings.

**AirREGI Data:**
Contains data from the restaurant point-of-sale service, offering details on transactions and sales.

**Restaurant Board Data:**
Includes reservation log management data, allowing us to understand booking patterns and customer arrival trends.

## Challenge

Predicting restaurant attendance is a complex task due to various unpredictable factors, such as weather and local competition. Additionally, newer restaurants with limited historical data face additional challenges. Participants in this competition are encouraged to develop innovative machine learning models that effectively utilize the provided datasets to forecast future customer numbers accurately.

## Evaluation

The models will be evaluated based on their ability to predict the total number of visitors to a restaurant for future dates. The evaluation metrics will be provided in the competition guidelines, and participants are encouraged to fine-tune their models for optimal performance.
